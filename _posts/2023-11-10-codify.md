## Hackthebox seasonal sept-dec 2023 - CODIFY

This november I decided to try the active seasonal machine, which was Codify. It was a fun easy linux machine, but I did have to do a bit of research for the user and the root flag.

### Enumeration

```console

# nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.11.239

Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.239
Host is up (0.021s latency).
Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

4445/tcp open  upnotifyp?
4446/tcp open  n1-fwp?
Service Info: Host: codify.htb; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

```
Here we see a website exposed on port 80 redirecting to http://codify.htb, since I am on windows, we have to go to the c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts to match this host to the IP address given.

### Foothold

Once on the website, we get greeted by a page bragging about their new sandbox feature where you can run javascript code in a safe space.

Let's try this thing, the first thing we try to do is create a reverse shell, but every nodeJS reverse shell I find online use `child_proces`, `fs` or `shellJS` and I can use none of that in this sandbox, understandable.

But looking at the others page of the site, in the about us section, they say they use the [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) tool. A bit more of reading on this and then I find a 2023 CVE affecting this package titled Sandbox Bypass on the Snyk website : https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-VM2-5537100.

We just need to copy this POC over and modify a bit the command ran to get us a reverse shell :

On the server, we can navigate as a service user (svc). Looking at the `/etc/passwd` file, we see the only 2 other user with a console are joshua and root. We now need to find a way to that joshua user.

### Joshua

Looking at the root of the website, we find a contact directory with what look like a ticketing API. There is also a file called tickets.db. If we look inside it, we find a user entry for joshua and what look like his hashed password. 

![db](/images/codify/db.png)

Let's google for a hash identifier website and look at what is this hash type. We find a bcrypt blowfish hash. 

![hashIdentifier](/images/codify/hashIdentifier.png)

We can try to crack this with hashcat and start with a classic dictionnary attack with the default rockyou.txt file. Like we thought, we find the password : spongebob1

![hashcat](/images/codify/hashcat.png)

We can now successfully ssh into the box with joshua and get our user.txt flag.

### Root

Lastly, we need to find a way to the root user. One of the enumeration step to privilege escalation in Linux box is to check the sudo privileges with `sudo -l`.

We see here that we can run the script /opt/script/mysql-backup.sh as root.

![sudo](/images/codify/dbscript.png)

when I did the box, I took a while to understand the bug, but then after experimenting a while locally, I remembered that in bash in the "==" operator, wildcard are authorized, so when we check for the condition for the root password, we can pass-in wildcard and try to bruteforce the password 1 character at a time.

With a bit of coding and some help from chatGPT, I came up with this python script that find the root password for us:

![python](/images/codify/python.png)

We can now login to root and get our final flag :
