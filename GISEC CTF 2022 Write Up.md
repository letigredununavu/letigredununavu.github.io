This march 21 to march 23 was Yogosha's GISEC CTF 2022 in which I participated. This was a team competition but I decided to participate solo. My team was PsyDucks in which I (letigredununavu) was the only participant. I manage to end the CTF at the 14th place. Here are some challenges and solutions I found interesting.\

Here, I find a cookie named 'role' with the value 'Guest' and the site hint us that we need to make this cookie 'Admin'.\
